# Skeleton

Fast project initialization.

Some projects does not have cli tools to initialize projects. I made this repo
for not having to install all the dependecies and configure things every time I
want to start a new project.
This is just a quick and dirty bash script that copies default project
structures for various frameworks and libraries.
